CS 253 Blog
----------

Here's a blog that I'm in the process of building in [Udacity CS253](http://www.udacity.com/course/cs253). Lots still to do but I thought it'd be good to version control it with git and keep it open source. It's built in Python with Jinga2 as the framework, runs well on GAE.

A working version is running on [Google App Engine](https://backburnerdev.appspot.com/blog)

Upgrades from the example being used in class:
* human readable urls
* ability to edit/delete posts
* use of cookies to change what content appears

Still to add:
* admin class for users to allow posting/editing privleges
* add content tags
* change homepage to only show 'x' most recent posts
* add comments
* link user and post entities together
